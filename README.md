# Back to the Arcades 

This project outlines a museum exhibition exploring the history of arcade machines and video games, aiming to unite both enthusiasts and newcomers. Drawing on Pac-Man creator Toru Iwatani’s aspiration to engage all demographics (Retro Gamer, 2016, p. 48), the exhibition will emphasise the cultural significance of arcade machines and employ interactive digital technology to ensure historical accessibility (cf. Not et al., 2019, pp. 11–12).
